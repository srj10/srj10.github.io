<p><pre> When i came to the 9th standard, I had to make a choice between computer applications and phsical education.
My thinking was lets keep computer applications as it will be more useful than physical education.I choose
computer applications as one of compulsory subjects and started attending the labs.They started teaching us JAVA.
 I REALLY ENJOYED THE CLASSES.</pre></p> <! PRE TAG IS USED TO THAT ONLY TILL THE PARTICULAR WORD I WANT IS DISPLAYED IN THAT LINE AND REST IS IN NEXT LINE>
<li>  <mark> HAVING DOUBTS </mark> </li>
<p><pre> During the 1st terminal exams,I wanted to shift to physical education because in that way, I could use my time for 
doing other subjects rather than spending much time on computer applications.THE OPTION WAS THERE TO SHIFT AFTER THE
1ST TERMINALS. I got 97marks,but i wanted to shift.I went to my computer teacher asking her permission to shift.She didn't
wanted me to shift but as i insisted,she told me to get the letter signed by principal.</pre>
<li><mark> FACING THE PRINCIPAL </mark></li>
<p><pre> I entered the principal's office to get the letter signed.He asked me the reason for it.I said "In Boards, 
students haven't scored well in computer paper and ".i was about to add something but he interrupted and said "that is
 those students problem ,not yours.".On his advice,I didn't change my subject.</pre><p>
 <li><mark> FROM FEAR TO LOVE </mark></li>
 <p></pre> afterwards as I kept on doing JAVA, my love for coding increased day by day.Now i feel that it was the best 
 advice of my life ,i.e.not change my subject that day.
<mark>Here,I AM TODAY.I HAVE LEFT NITs JUST BECAUSE I DIDN'T GET CSE FIELD THERE.THE COLLEGE DOESN'T MATTER TO ME,MY FIELD
 DOES.I LOVE TO CODE MAYBE I AM NOT THAT GREAT AT IT RIGHT NOW,BUT I AM LEARNING DAY BY DAY.<mark> </pre><p>
